O\$P\$ is an expense-tracker application that allows
the user to keep track of their expenditure with ease!
Users can also manage expenses in a group setting with
simple splitting functions, as well as view analytics
of their spending across multiple categories.

## 2. Setup Guide

---

### 2.1 Prerequisites

1.  Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed on your PC. **[Version 17 is preferred]**
2.  You may download [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) for Mac users and [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/) for Windows users.
3.  If you have it installed already, you may check it by running `java -version` in your terminal.
4.  Download the latest release page.
5.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **O\$P$ budget tracking app** 🙂.
6.  Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp.jar` command to run the application.
7.  Type the command in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it.
8.  **Example:** Typing `help` and pressing **Enter** will open a mini window showing a list of all possible commands.
9.  Refer to the [features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/125Cg7wzuc4XFo3wsziwL2f64KN1uUfvFL5dIm6IQrSk/edit?tab=t.xl7ogrtj0a5q#heading=h.61o02m6y9xrc) section below for details on all commands and functionalities.

## 3. Design

---

### 3.1.0 UI Class

This class displays system output messages whenever an action has occurred or invoked by the user using the listed commands.

### Methods

#### `handleUserInput()`

This method continuously prompts the user for input and processes commands accordingly. It ensures that the application runs until the user chooses to exit.

#### Functionality:

1. Displays a prompt for the user to enter a command.
2. Reads user input if available.
3. Calls `processCommand` to handle the command.
4. Displays a divider after processing each command (if still running).
5. If no input is available, it displays an empty input message and stops execution.

### `processCommand()`

This method processes user input by mapping commands to their corresponding functionalities. The commands are predefined in the `Commands` class.

#### Functionality:

1. Trims and converts user input to lowercase.
2. Uses a `switch` statement to execute the appropriate method based on the input.
3. Handles multiple functionalities, including expense management, group operations, currency conversion, and data export.
4. Displays an error message for invalid commands.

### 3.1.1 DataStorage Class

The data storage class initializes the expense.txt file to store expenses created by the user on app start-up and its contents are saved upon exit.

### File Handling

- **Data File:** The expense data is stored in `expenses.txt`.
- **Separator:** Each entry in the file is delimited using `|`.
- **Assertions:** Used to ensure correct program behavior.

### Methods

#### `ensureFileExists()`

Ensures that the data file exists. If the file does not exist, it is created.

- Uses `File.createNewFile()`.
- Prints a message if a new file is created.
- Handles `IOException` in case of errors.
- Assertion: Checks that the file exists after execution.

#### `saveExpenses(List<Expense> expenses)`

Saves a list of expenses to the data file.

- Iterates through `expenses` and writes each expense to `expenses.txt`.
- Each expense is stored with attributes separated by `|`.
- Returns `true` if saving is successful, `false` otherwise.
- Handles `IOException`.
- Assertion: Ensures `expenses` is not null before execution.

#### `loadExpenses()`

Loads expenses from the data file.

- Reads each line and splits it using `|`.
- Extracts attributes and creates `Expense` objects.
- Returns a list of `Expense` objects.
- Handles `FileNotFoundException`.

#### `resetExpenses()`

Clears all data in `expenses.txt`. Used mainly for testing.

- Writes an empty string to the file.
- Handles `IOException`.
- Assertion: Ensures the file is empty after reset.

### 3.1.2 GroupStorage Class

The GroupStorage class is responsible for managing the storage of user-created groups and their associated members.
The group data is saved in a text file named groups.txt, and it is loaded whenever the application starts.

### File Handling

- **Data File:** The expense data is stored in `groups.txt`.
- **Separator:** Each entry in the file is delimited using `|`.
- **Group Header:** Each group entry starts with `[GROUP]` followed by the group name.
- **Assertions:** Used to ensure correct program behavior, such as non-null lists and group objects.

### Methods

#### `saveGroups(List<Group> groups)`

Saves a list of groups and their members to the data file.

- Iterates through the `groups` list and writes each group to `groups.txt`
- Each group is stored with the following format:
  - Group header: `[GROUP]|<group_name>`
  - Friend entries: `<group_name>|<friend_name>`
- Uses `FileWriter` for file operations.
- Handles `IOException` to manage file writing errors.

#### `loadGroups()`

Loads groups and their members from the data file.

- Reads each line from the file and splits it using the `|` separator.
- Identifies group headers `([GROUP]|<group_name>)` and creates a new `Group` object.
- For each friend entry, associates the friend with the current group.
- Returns a list of `Group` objects.
- Uses `Scanner` for file reading.
- Handles `FileNotFoundException` when the file does not exist.

### 3.1.3 Commands Class

All approved commands that can be used within the application are stored here as macros. The UI class contains a switch-case block
that checks if the user input matches any of these commands and handles invalid commands.

#### Command List

Below are the commands supported by the application:

| Command           | Description                                    |

### 3.1.4 ExpenseCommands Classes

The ExpenseCommand class handles all expense-related operations in the application. It provides functionality for adding, deleting, editing, and managing expenses.

#### **Adding Expenses**

The `executeAddExpense()` method manages the addition of new expenses with the following features:

- Ensures the user input follows the correct format (`add/<title>/<category>/<date>/<amount>`). If the format is invalid, it prompts the user with the correct usage instructions.
- Performs comprehensive validation of all input fields:
  - Checks that none of the required fields (title, category, date, amount) are empty.
  - Validates that the provided title is unique among existing expenses.
  - Verifies the category is one of the valid predefined categories (Food, Shopping, Travel, Entertainment, Miscellaneous).
  - Ensures the date adheres to the `DD-MM-YYYY` format and represents a valid calendar date (with proper days per month and leap year handling).
  - Validates that the amount is a valid number, not negative, and not zero.
  - Checks that the amount does not exceed the maximum allowed limit of 50,000 SGD (or its equivalent in other currencies).
- Constructs a new `Expense` object with the validated inputs and adds it to the `budgetManager`. Upon success, it displays the added expense details.
- Implements robust error handling for all validation steps, providing clear error messages to guide the user.

#### Editing Expenses

The `executeEditExpense()` method manages the editing of existing expenses with the following features:

- Ensures the user input follows the correct format (`edit/<expense ID>/<new title>/<new category>/<new date>/<new amount>`). If the format is invalid, it prompts the user with the correct usage instructions.
- Validates that the expense ID is not empty and is a valid number within the range of existing expenses.
- Allows users to skip updating specific fields (title, category, date, or amount) by entering `"x"`. This flexibility ensures only desired fields are modified.
- Performs the same validation on the provided fields as during addition:
  - For categories, verifies it's one of the predefined valid categories.
  - For dates, ensures it adheres to the `DD-MM-YYYY` format and represents a valid calendar date.
  - For amounts, validates that it's a valid number, not negative, and not zero, while also checking against the maximum allowed limit.
- Calls the `budgetManager.editExpense()` method to apply the changes to the specified expense and displays the updated details upon success.
- Implements comprehensive error handling for all validation steps and edge cases, including invalid input formats and out-of-range values.

#### **Deleting Expenses**

The `executeDeleteExpense()` method manages the deletion of existing expenses with the following features:

- Ensures the user input follows the correct format (`delete/<expense ID>`). If the format is invalid, it prompts the user with the correct usage instructions.
- Converts the provided expense ID to a zero-based index and checks if it falls within the valid range of existing expenses. If the index is invalid, it notifies the user to enter a valid expense number.
- Displays the expense details and asks the user to confirm the deletion (`y/n`). If the user does not confirm, the deletion is aborted.
- Calls the `budgetManager.deleteExpense()` method to remove the specified expense. The deleted expense is displayed upon success.
- Updates the `owesData.txt` file to reflect any changes in owed amounts due to the deletion.
- Catches and handles exceptions such as `NumberFormatException` (for invalid expense IDs), `IndexOutOfBoundsException` (for out-of-range indices), and general exceptions to provide meaningful feedback to the user.
- Ensures the internal state remains consistent by validating the existence of the expense before deletion.

#### Displaying Settled Expenses

The `displaySettledExpenses()` method manages the display of settled expenses with these features:

- Retrieves all expenses from budgetManager before filtering
- Checks for empty expense lists and displays an appropriate message
- Prints the current currency to ensure user is aware which currency the amounts are printed in
- Iterates through the expense list while filtering for settled expenses
- Handles edge cases gracefully, such as no settled expenses found
- Uses proper singular/plural formatting for the summary output

#### Displaying Unsettled Expenses

The `displayUnsettledExpenses()` method manages the display of unsettled expenses with these features:

- Retrieves all expenses from budgetManager before filtering
- Checks for empty expense lists and displays an appropriate message
- Prints the current currency to ensure user is aware which currency the amounts are printed in
- Iterates through the expense list while filtering for unsettled expenses
- Handles edge cases gracefully, such as no unsettled expenses found
- Uses proper singular/plural formatting for the summary output

#### Marking Expenses

The `executeMarkCommand(String command)` method manages marking an expense as settled with these features:

- Attempts to mark the specified expense using budgetManager.markExpense()
- Handles invalid indices gracefully with an IndexOutOfBoundsException
- Handles non-numeric input with a NumberFormatException
- Provides clear error messages to guide the user toward valid input

#### Unmarking Expenses

The `executeUnmarkCommand(String command)` method manages unmarking an expense as unsettled with these features:

- Attempts to unmark the specified expense using budgetManager.unmarkExpense()
- Handles invalid indices gracefully with an IndexOutOfBoundsException
- Handles non-numeric input with a NumberFormatException
- Provides clear error messages to guide the user toward valid input

#### Finding Specific Expenses

The `findExpense(String command)` method in the `seedu.duke.commands` package is responsible for searching and displaying expenses that match a given keyword. It helps users efficiently locate expenses by title or description.

- Prompts the user to enter a keyword to search for expenses.
- Validates that the keyword is not empty.
- Retrieves all stored expenses using `budgetManager.getAllExpenses()`.
- Filters expenses whose title or description contains the keyword (case-insensitive).
- Displays the list of matching expenses, if any.

#### Expense Summaries

The class provides comprehensive expense summary functionality:

1. Viewing Summaries:

   - Supports multiple view types with proper validation:
     - Monthly Summary (`summary/BY-MONTH/N`): Shows total expenses and count per month
     - Category-wise Summary (`summary/BY-CATEGORY/Y` or `summary/BY-CATEGORY/N`): Shows total expenses and count per category
   - Validates the command format, ensuring it contains all required parameters (view type and visualization option)
   - Enforces view-specific restrictions (e.g., BY-MONTH view only supports the N option without visualization)
   - Validates that the visualization choice is either Y or N
   - Gracefully handles empty expense lists with appropriate messages
   - Processes multiple months or categories correctly when displaying data

2. Exporting Summaries:

   - Export to text files (monthly_summary.txt, category_summary.txt)
   - Same formatting as view summaries
   - Error handling for file operations
   - Confirmation messages for successful exports

3. Data Organization:
   - Uses Maps to group and aggregate expenses
   - Maintains both totals and counts
   - Sorts data for better readability
   - Handles empty expense lists gracefully

#### Error Handling

Both methods implement comprehensive error handling:

- NumberFormatException for invalid number inputs
- IndexOutOfBoundsException for invalid indices
- FileNotFoundException for file operations
- General exception handling with user-friendly messages

#### Data Validation

The class uses assertions to validate:

- Non-null objects
- Valid indices
- Non-negative amounts
- Valid expense states

### 3.1.5 FriendsCommands Class

The FriendsCommands class handles all friends and groups related operations in the application. It provides functionality for adding, deleting, and managing friend groups.

#### Checking if a group/member name is valid

The `isValidName(String name)` method is a utility function used to validate input strings for group names and member names. It ensures that the input follows specific naming conventions and helps maintain data integrity.

- **Input validation:**

  - Accepts a single `String` parameter `name`.

- **Null and empty check:**

  - Method checks if the input is `null` or an empty string after trimming the whitespace.
  - If either condition is met, the method returns `false`.

- **Name format validation**
  - Uses a regular expression to validate that the name contains only letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and spaces.
  - If all conditions are met, the method returns `true`
  - If even one is violated, it returns `false`.

#### Creating a new group

The `createGroup(String command)` method is responsible for creating a new group within the application.

- **Group name Input:**

  - The method takes in the `command` and is parsed.
  - The parsed input is then validated using the `isValidName(String name)` method.

- **Adding Group Members:**

  - Once a valid group is created, user is prompted to add members.
  - User can continue to input multiple member names, each name is validated by the `isValidName(String name)` method.
  - Process continues until user types 'done'.
  - Each valid member name is used to create a new `Friend` object, which is then added to the group using `groupManager.addFriendToGroup(String groupName, new Friend(name, groupName))`.

- **Saving the Group:**
  - Once the group creation is complete, the method saves the group using `groupManager.saveGroups()`
  - A success message is displayed upon creation.

#### Remove a Group

The `removeGroup(String command)` is used to delete an entire group from the group management system.

- **Input:**

  - Parses the input command to retrieve the group name.
  - Trims any leading or trailing whitespaces from the input.

- **Group Existence Check:**

  - Uses `groupManager.groupExists(groupName)` to verify whether the specified group exists.
  - If group does not exist, the method prints "Group does not exist."

- **Delete confirmation:**

  - Before removal, the method prompts the user to confirm: "Are you sure you want to remove [groupName]? (y/n)"
  - If the user does not input "y", the operation to remove is cancelled.

- **Group Removal:**
  - If confirmed, the method calls `groupManager.removeGroup(groupName)` to remove the group from the group management system.
  - The updated group list is saved using `groupManager.saveGroups()`.

#### Viewing the Transactions of a Member in a Group

The viewMember(String command) method is responsible for displaying the transactions of a particular member in a group. It lists all the expenses owed/attributed to the particular user. It is useful to track and log the expenses.

- Input:

  - If the group does not exist, the method prints a "Group not found" message and terminates.

  - Tampering Checking:

  - Checks whether the file has been tampered with and clear the storage file if the file has likely been tampered with based on the storage file's checksum.

- Loading Expense Data:

  - The method reads from the owedAmounts.txt file, which contains expense data.
  - It loads this data into a map owedAmounts, where:
    - The key is the member's name.
    - The value is the accumulated amount they owe.
  - The method ensures that the amounts are accumulated for each member instead of being overwritten.

- Display Group Members and Expenses:
  - Uses groupManager.getGroupMembers(groupName) to fetch the list of group members.
  - If the group has no members, it displays "No members in this group."
  - For each member, it:
    - Retrieves their name.
    - Checks the owedAmounts map for any recorded expenses.
    - Displays the member's name along with the accumulated expense amount.
  - If a member has no recorded expense, the amount displayed is 0.00.

  - If a member has no recorded expense, the amount displayed is 0.00.

#### Viewing all user's Groups

The `viewAllGroups()` method is designed to display a list of all the groups that the user has created or is a part of. It provides a quick overview of the existing groups managed by the application.

- **Check for existing groups:**

  - Uses `groupManager.getGroups()` to retrieve a list of all groups.
  - If the list is empty, the method prints "You have no groups".

- **Displaying Groups:**
  - If the list is not empty, the method iterates over each group and prints its details using the `toString()` method of the Group class.
  - This allows the user to see a comprehensive list of all group names and any other associated information that the Group class's `toString()` method returns.

#### Viewing group directly

The `viewGroupDirect()` method is responsible for displaying the details of a specific group, it includes its members and associated expenses. The user cannot call it directly but it is called by the split function. It takes in the groupname from the `executeSplit()` method so that the user is not required to enter the group name and it acts as a summary after the split operation.

This method is essential for users who wish to view group details and any expenses related to group members.

#### Add a member

The `addMember(String command)` method allows the user to add a new member to an existing group. If the specified group does not exist, the method offers the option to create the group and add the member simultaneously.

- **Input:**

  - Member name:
    - Parses the user input `command` to retrieve the name of new member to be added.
    - Uses `isValidName(String name)` to validate the input, ensuring it does not contain special characters or empty spaces.
    - Repeats the prompt until a valid name is entered.
  - Group name:
    - Parses user input `command` to retrieve group name to which the member should be added.
    - Similarly, the name is validated to avoid empty or invalid names.

- **Group Existence Check:**

  - Uses `groupManager.groupExists(groupName)` to verify whether the specified group already exists.

- **Adding Member to existing group:**

  - If the group exists:
    - Uses `groupManager.addFriendToGroup(groupName, new Friend(name, groupName))` to add the member.
    - Calls `groupManager.saveGroups()` to save the updated group data.
    - Displays a success message indicating that the member has been added to the group.

- **Handling non-existent groups:**
  - If the group does not exist:
    - Asks the user if they would like to create the group.
  - If the user enters "y":
    - Creates the group and adds the member directly.
    - Saves the new group and member data.
    - Displays a message confirming the creation and addition.
  - If the user enters "no":
    - Cancels the operation and notifies the user that the member was not added.

#### Remove a member

The `removeMember(String command)` method allows the user to add a new member to an existing group. If the specified group does not exist, the method offers the option to create the group and add the member simultaneously.

- **Input:**

  - Member name:
    - Parses the input `command` to retrieve the name of new member to be removed.
    - Trims any leading or trailing whitespaces from the input.
  - Group name:
    - Parses the input `command` to retrieve the group name to which the member should be removed.

  - Before removal, the method prompts the user to confirm: "Are you sure you want to remove [memberName] from [groupName]? (y/n)"
  - If the user does not input "y", the operation to remove is cancelled.

- **Member Removal:**
  - If confirmed, the method iterates through the list of groups returned by `groupManager.getGroups()`.
  - Locates the specified group by comparing the group name.
  - Uses the `removeFriend(String friendName)` method to attempt to remove the specified member from the group.
  - If successful, it sets the removed flag to true and breaks out of the loop.

### 3.1.6 SplitCommand Class

The `SplitCommand` class handles the functionality of splitting expenses among members in a group. It supports both equal and manual assignment (absolute or percentage-based) and ensures transaction details are logged with tamper prevention through checksum verification.

`split/<equal | assign>/<expense index>/<group name>`

- Parse and validate the split command format:  
  `split/<equal|assign>/<expense index>/<group name>`

- **Equal Split:**  
  Divides the total expense amount equally among all group members.

- **Manual Split:**  
  Allows the user to specify individual shares using either absolute amounts or percentages. After entering the command, the user is prompted to choose a method (`/a` for absolute amounts or `/p` for percentages) and to input the share for each member. The system validates the input and ensures that the full expense is allocated.

- **Duplicate Prevention:**  
  Before proceeding, the class checks the transaction log to ensure that the same expense has not already been split for the specified group. If a duplicate is detected, the split is aborted and an error message is displayed.

- **Error and Exception Handling:**  
  Before proceeding, the parser also checks to ensure that all the input is valid and raises the appropriate exceptions. This check is done for negative index, NULL, and other invalid inputs and parameters.

- **Tamper Checking:**  
  The program writes the checksum of the `owedAmounts.txt` file to a seperate file to ensure data integrity. When the `owedAmounts.txt` is accessed by other functions, the program uses the checksum to determine if the file has been tampered with. If it has, the data files are then purged. This behavior should not occur under normal circumstances and only happens if a user accidentally/maliciously modifies the file's contents.

- **Transaction Logging:**  
  For every split operation, detailed transaction records are created in the format:  
  `Transaction: Expense: <title>, Date: <date>, Group: <group>, Member: <member> owes: <amount>`

#### Key Methods for Split

#### `SplitCommand(Scanner scanner, GroupManager groupManager, FriendsCommands friendsCommands)`

Initializes the `SplitCommand` instance with the provided dependencies.

- Executes equal or manual splitting
- Updates file and calls group display

- **Equal Split:**

  - Divides total amount equally among all members.
  - Appends individual owed shares to the transaction log.

- **Manual Split:**

  - Prompts user to choose between absolute amounts (`/a`) or percentages (`/p`).
  - **Manual Split – Absolute:**
    - Prompts for each member's assigned amount.
    - Tracks remaining amount and prevents over-allocation.
    - Logs each owed amount to storage.
  - **Manual Split – Percentage:**
    - Prompts for each member's share percentage.
    - Computes owed amount as `totalAmount * (percentage / 100)`.
    - Validates total assigned percentages.

- Calls `friendsCommands.viewGroupDirect()` to update group display after split.

#### `createTransactionRecord(...)`

# 4. Overall Application Architecture

### 4.1 Application Class Diagram

![ApplicationFlowChart.drawio.png](diagrams/ApplicationFlowChart.drawio.png)

O\$P\$ is the main class of application which the user can interact with directly. The command input from the user is processed by the UI class which validates and parses the command.
This class will check for any valid keywords in the input. Once the keywords are present, it will pass the input to its respective classes that the command is related to (see above diagram)
to validate the format and details of the command. Upon successful validation and execution of the command, the new data is written to the .txt files within the program directory and saved
after the command duration has ended and upon exiting the program, handled by the DataStorage class.

### 4.2 Expense CRUD Feature

Below is the UML sequence diagram for the split class. It requires external dependencies such as DataStorage, GRoupManager, OwesStorage, and FriendsCommands to seamlessly integrate the split function. A large part of the calls are to get data from the other classes. Another part is validating input and ensuring that the input is all valid and that the operation is not illegal. Afterwards, it calls the `executeSplit()` method to divide it, with the method prompting for more information regarding the type of split (manual assignment, via absolute values and percentages or via equal splitting). It has to get the data of groups and friends from other classes, and saves and loads using the OwesStorage class. The OwesStorage class implements tamper-checking to help ensure that the data has not been manipulated while being stored.

![SplitClassSequenceDiagram.png](diagrams/SplitClassSequenceDiagram.png)

### 4.3 Split Expense Feature

![ApplicationFlowChart.drawio.png](diagrams/ApplicationFlowChart.drawio.png)

O\$P\$ is the main class of application which the user can interact with directly. The command input from the user is processed by the UI class which validates and parses the command.
This class will check for any valid keywords in the input. Once the keywords are present, it will pass the input to its respective classes that the command is related to (see above diagram)
to validate the format and details of the command. Upon successful validation and execution of the command, the new data is written to the .txt files within the program directory and saved
after the command duration has ended and upon exiting the program, handled by the DataStorage class.

### 4.4 Change Currency Feature

Below is the UML sequence diagram for the classes involved in the "Change Currency" operation.
![CurrencySequenceDiagram.png](diagrams/CurrencySequenceDiagram.png "Currency Sequence Diagram")

Below is the UML Object diagram illustrating the state of a Currency object after these actions: the addition of the first expense titled "Groceries shopping" (description: "tomatoes", date: "20-01-2025", amount: 5.00, groupName: "Shoppers"), the initial setting of currentCurrency to SGD, and the subsequent input of `change-currency/1/USD/0.7`, which converts the currency to USD at a rate of 0.7.

   - Handles currency formatting
   - Manages color schemes and layouts

3. **User Interface Layer**
   - Provides interactive controls
   - Handles view selection
   - Manages display preferences
   - Supports export functionality

#### Important Implementation Note:

**API Limitation**: Due to a limitation in the XChart visualization library, users must close any pie chart visualization windows before exiting the program. If visualization windows remain open when attempting to exit, the application will not terminate properly. This is a known issue with the visualization API and not a bug in the application itself.

#### Sequence Flow:

1. User requests visualization
2. System aggregates relevant data
3. Data is processed and categorized
4. Visualization engine generates appropriate charts
5. UI layer presents the visualization
6. User can interact with the visualization

### 5.1.2 Value proposition

When friends travel together, they often struggle to split costs and track expenses for accommodations, dining, transportation, and activities. Relying on makeshift spreadsheets,
group chat records, or mental math leads to confusion about who owes what, resulting in financial strain and potential conflict. Travelers need a unified budgeting and expense‐splitting
solution that accurately records costs, updates balances in real time, and keeps everyone informed—allowing them to focus on enjoying their trip rather than worrying about the numbers.
