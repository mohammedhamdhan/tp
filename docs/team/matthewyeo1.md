O\$P\$ is an expense-tracker application that allows the user to keep track of their expenditure with ease! Users can also manage expenses in a group setting with simple 
splitting functions, as well as view analytics of their spending across multiple categories.

### Features Implemented
Here is the list of features implemented:

#### 1. Data Storage Feature

- **Function**: User data entered during each session is automatically saved in .txt files upon exiting the application and loaded each time the application starts.
- **Justification**: Users benefit from having their data stored automatically, avoiding the need to re-enter information each session.

#### 2. Comprehensive UI/UX

- **Function**: The application contains a list of commands that the user can input, dividers to separate each user command and system output messages for each action.
- **Justification**: Users can easily navigate through the application using short and concise commands for each feature and understand what is happening for each action.

#### 3. Expense Classification Algorithm

- **Function**: An auxiliary function that calculates the relative percentages of each category according to the title and description of the user's expenses. 
- **Justification**: Users are able to view their expense distribution in number and percentages with visuals and can hence make more informed decisions for future expenditure.

### Enhancements Implemented

#### Unit Tests Across Storage and Expense-Related Classes
- **Input Validation**: Test cases validate inputs and ensure that error messages are returned for invalid entries.
- **Boundary and Edge Case Tests**: Test cases check for negative values, null values, and other edge cases to ensure proper handling.
- **Error Handling**: Test cases confirm that appropriate error messages are displayed when specific errors occur.
- **Data Storage and Loading**: Test cases verify that the save file is created correctly and that data is properly saved and loaded.
