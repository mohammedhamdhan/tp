### Manage Expenses

#### Add an expense: `add`

- **Format:** `add/<title>/<category>/<date>/<amount>`

Add an expense with a title, description, date, amount. You have to first enter
the `add` keyword, followed by the `title`,`category`, `date`, `amount`, each separated by a `/`.

The `date` field has to follow the DD-MM-YYYY format. You can choose the date to be in the past (earliest 2000),
present and future, as long as it is a legitimate date (e.g. NOT 99-99-9999).

Once the expense has been added, it is unsettled. Typing `list-unsettled` will allow you to view
your newly added expense, just like `list`.

The `category` field has to be one of these categories (Food/Travel/Entertainment/Shopping/Miscellaneous).

The `amount` can be entered as a whole number or floating-point number. The result will be rounded off to 2 decimal
places. The `amount` is capped at 50,000SGD or its equivalent if your expenses are in another currency.

- **Example Usage:**

```
add/Chicken Rice/Food/25-12-2025/100
```

```
Expense added successfully:
Title: chicken rice
Category: Food
Date: 25-12-2025
Amount: 100.00
```

The entry will automatically be tagged with a unique expense ID.

You are not allowed to add an expense containing a `title` of an expense that already exists.

---

#### Edit an expense: `edit`

Edit an existing expense. Follows the same constraints and parameter-filling procedure as the `add` command. 'X' can be used to keep existing values.

- **Format:** `edit/<expense ID>/<new title>/<new category>/<new date>/<new amount>`

- **Example Usage:**

```
edit/1/chicken rice/food/20-08-2004/20
```

- **Output:**
  If you choose to change the amount:

```
Expense edited successfully:
Title: chicken rice
Category: Food
Date: 20-08-2004
Amount: 100.00
```

If you choose to change the category:

```
Expense edited successfully:
Title: chicken rice
Category: Micellaneous
Date: 20-08-2004
Amount: 20.00
```

If you choose to keep the current category:

```
Expense edited successfully:
Title: chicken rice
Category: Food
Date: 20-08-2004
Amount: 20.00
```

---

#### Delete an expense: `delete`

Delete an expense followed by the desired expense index to remove it from the `list`.
You will see the title, description, date and amount of the to-be-deleted expense and
be prompted to confirm the deletion.

Expense ID is 1-index, so to delete your second expense, type `delete/2`.

- **Format:** `delete/<expense ID>`

  ```
  Transactions for member 'john' in group 'testGroup':
  Transaction: Expense: expense1, Date: 10-10-2025, Group: testGroup, Member: john owes: 10.00
  Transaction: Expense: expense2, Date: 10-10-2025, Group: testGroup, Member: john owes: 30.00

- If the same user is there in two different groups, the `view-group` command only shows the split across members for that particular group. If you would like to view transactions of a single member across multiple groups, use `view-member`

---

#### Add Friends to a group: `add-member`

Adds a user to a group.

- **Format:** `add-member/<member-name>/<group-name>`
- **Usage:** `add-member/hij/test`

- **Output:**

### Manage Payments:

#### Split an expense among group members: `split`

Splits a selected expense among members of a specific group, either **equally** or through **manual assignment**
(using absolute amounts or percentages).

- **Format:**
  `split/<equal|assign>/<expense index>/<group name>`

- **Usage:**
  `split/equal/1/testGroup`

- **Constraints:**

- Expense index must be a **positive integer** (starting from 1).
- The group must already exist and contain at least one member.
- The same expense cannot be split more than once by the same group.
- You can split either:

  - Equally among all members, or
  - Manually assign amounts using absolute values (`/a`) or percentages (`/p`).

- **Examples:**

- **Equal Split:**

  ```
  split/equal/1/friends
  ```

  **Output:**

  ```
  Selected expense amount: 100.00
  Splitting 100.00 equally among 2 members of group "friends":
  Transaction: Expense: Lunch, Date: 01-01-2025, Group: friends, Member: Alice owes: 50.00
  Transaction: Expense: Lunch, Date: 01-01-2025, Group: friends, Member: Bob owes: 50.00
  Updated list of transactions!
  ```

- **Manual Split (Absolute Amounts):**

  ```
  split/assign/1/friends
  ```

  **Prompted interaction:**

  ```
  Type '/a' for absolute amounts OR '/p' for percentages: /a
  Total expense amount to split: 100.00
  You can assign up to 100.00 in total.
  Enter amount for Alice: 30
  Remaining expense: 70.00
  Enter amount for Bob: 70
  ```

  **Output:**

  ```
  Transaction: Expense: Lunch, Date: 01-01-2025, Group: friends, Member: Alice owes: 30.00
  Transaction: Expense: Lunch, Date: 01-01-2025, Group: friends, Member: Bob owes: 70.00
  Updated list of transactions!
  ```

- **Manual Split (Percentage-Based):**

  ```
  split/assign/1/friends
  ```

  **Prompted interaction:**

  ```
  Type '/a' for absolute amounts OR '/p' for percentages: /p
  Total expense is 100.00. You can assign up to 100% in total.
  Enter percentage for Alice: 40
  Remaining percentage: 60.00%
  Enter percentage for Bob: 60
  ```

  **Output:**

  ```
  Transaction: Expense: Lunch, Date: 01-01-2025, Group: friends, Member: Alice owes: 40.00
  Transaction: Expense: Lunch, Date: 01-01-2025, Group: friends, Member: Bob owes: 60.00
  Updated list of transactions!
  ```

- **Notes:**

- While names are taken to be unique throughout the entire program, "John" in group1 is the same as "John" in group2. Splitting is within each group.
- For the manual `assign` option, the absolute amount and percentage does not need to add up to 100% the full amount. While it cannot exceed the total value of the expense, the sum can be smaller than the full amount.
- The split function does not take into account you as the user. Add yourself as a member to the group if you'd like to keep track of your split expenses in that particular group.
- Each expense can only be split once per group.
- Splitting an expense bakes in the value for that member, when the expense is edited/deleted, the amount owed for the members (when it was split) does not change.
- Avoid using floating point numbers in the percentage ("/p" > "33.3") as it may be inprecise due to the way the number are stored.
- Calling the split function does not mark or settle the expense. The user has to manually trigger those events through the prescribed commands.
- An expense can be split multiple times (by different groups).
- All transaction details are stored per member and per group for tracking and retrieval.

---

### Expense Analytics:

#### View summary of expenses: `summary`

Displays comprehensive analytics of your expenses through different visualization options. This command helps you track and analyze your spending patterns.

- **Format:** `summary/<BY-MONTH|BY-CATEGORY>/<Y|N>`

  - First parameter must be either `BY-MONTH` or `BY-CATEGORY`
  - Second parameter must be `Y` or `N` for visualization

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb6f031-9924-43d2-ab6b-3540e15fcefb)

- **Notes about Pie Chart Visualization:**
  - Only available for category-wise summary
  - Shows percentages to one decimal place
  - For expenses with large value differences (e.g., $50,000 vs $10):
    - Very small expenses may not be clearly visible on the chart
    - Hover over segments to see exact values
    - Legend shows both amount and percentage for each category
  - **IMPORTANT**: You must close the pie chart window before exiting the program. Due to a limitation in the visualization API, if you do not close the window, the program will not terminate properly.
  - Chart window will automatically close when program exits
  - Close the chart window to return to the application
